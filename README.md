# Handwritten_digit_recognizer

A deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from images using a trained neural network.It uses a pre-trained CNN model (digit_recognizer.h5) trained on the MNIST dataset  using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to recognize digits (0–9) drawn in front of your webcam.

📋 Project Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System that can identify digits written by humans. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels each).


🚀 Features
  •	⚡ Uses pre-trained model (digit_recognizer.h5) — no need to train every time
	•	🧠 CNN-based architecture for high accuracy (~98–99%)
	•	🖥️ Live digit recognition from webcam feed

⚙️ Installation
